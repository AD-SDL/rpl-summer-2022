**Project name**: Pyhamilton Protocol Implementation on Hudson 

**Advisors**: Casey Stone, Priyanka Setty, Abe Stroka, Jeff Dewey

**Email**: ahidalgo@anl.gov
## Project description 
For this project, we will reproduce one of the biological experiments presented in this paper using the Python interface that has been developed for the Hudson SOLO liquid handler and Hudson SoftLinx integration system. We aim to prove that our completely open-source Python API is capable of executing the same biological experiments as Pyhamilton with similar results. Students on this project will also contribute to the growing library of biological protocols written for our Hudson robotic experimentation platform. 
## Diary
### 6/27/22
* Started to write the python code for the PyHamilton protocol. 

### 6/28/22
* Finished the Python code for the PyHamilton protocol (assay plate and dilution plate steps) 
* Had a meeting with Casey to discuss the code and had to make some changes to make the code less time consuming.
