**Project name**: Pyhamilton Protocol Implementation on Hudson 

**Advisors**: Casey Stone, Priyanka Setty, Abe Stroka, Jeff Dewey

**Email**: ahidalgo@anl.gov
## Project description 
For this project, we will reproduce one of the biological experiments presented in this paper using the Python interface that has been developed for the Hudson SOLO liquid handler and Hudson SoftLinx integration system. We aim to prove that our completely open-source Python API is capable of executing the same biological experiments as Pyhamilton with similar results. Students on this project will also contribute to the growing library of biological protocols written for our Hudson robotic experimentation platform. 
## Diary
### 6/27/22
* Started to write the python code for the PyHamilton protocol. 

### 6/28/22
* Finished the Python code for the PyHamilton protocol (assay plate and dilution plate steps) 
* Had a meeting with Casey to discuss the code and had to make some changes to make the code less time consuming.

### 6/29/22
* We started to write the code for the dilution plate, transfering cell from the stock cells plate to the dilution plate. 
* Worked on figuring out the different volumes to use of the nutrients. 
* Looked for more paper about DNA Assembly for Pryianka's project. 

### 6/30/22 
* I attended the a meeting about the basics of DNA assembly and how one might write code to execute this workflow on the Opentrons OT-2s. 
* We finished the code for the dilution plate with the updated concentrations for each nutrient and media. 
* We made final changes to the code and made sure we had everything mapped out for the assay plate.
* I attended my student connects meeting.

### 7/01/22
* Halona, Gillian and I met to create our slides for the third summer student meeting. 
* I attended the summer students meeting and presented the progress we have made with the project, our challenges and our next steps. 
* I attended the journal club and was the scribbe (took notes of the presentation). 

### 7/05/22
* Worked remotely reading the article for my journal club presentation, wrote some of the steps down for Pryianka's project and made sure our code was not missing anything. 

### 7/06/22 
* Took a se minar on how to prepare our posters 
* Met with Casey to review our code
* Went to the Biology Building and tested the hso files and fixed a few mistakes we had. 
* Found out that the pippetes only hold a max volume of 180 which was less than we thought so we had to do more loops to get the correct volume on each well. 

### 7/07/22 
* Worked on my journal club presentation
* Met with Carla to discuss the paper for my journal club presentation 
* Worked on fixing the code for the dilution plate (getting the correct volume and doing the correct amount of loops for each step in orther to get the desired final volume for every well). 

### 7/08/22 
* Worked on our update presentation for the RPL update meeting and the attended the meeting. 
* Practiced our presentation for journal club and then gave our presentation in the afternoon. 

### 7/11/22 
* Worked with when to refil the tip box during the protocol and wrote the code for it. 
* Had a mandatory mid-point meeting with Robert Schuch to talk about my experience during the intership, my project, etc. 
* Tested the hso files on the Hudson and fixed some mistakes we had in the code. 

### 7/12/22
* Worked on writting the steps down for some of the papers I found for Pryianka's project. 
* Made a few changes to the code and fixed some mistakes we had left. 

### 7/13/22 
* Worked on writting the steps down for some of the other papers I found for Pryianka's project. 
* Attended a mandatory Seminar about our research project presentations and all the deliverables. 

### 7/14/22
* Worked on finishing writting down the steps down for all of Pryianka's papers for her project. 
* Attended Rory's Learn something new tutorial about computer vision 

### 7/15/22
* Completed a run test of the PyHamilton protocol on the Hudson using water and food coloring. 
* Made some adjustments to the code based on how the trial went. 
* Worked on the presentation for RPL's update meeting and then went to the meeting. 
* Started working on my poster. 

### 7/18/22
* Worked on my poster and other deliverables 
* Finished fixing some minor adjustments on the code 

### 7/19/22
* Completed a test run of the PyHamilton protocol in triplicate. 
* Made some adjustments based on how the testing went 
* Completed my first draft of my poster and sent it to Carla and Casey for feedback. 

### 7/20/22 
* Attended a mandatory seminar about how to write a resume. 
* Recieved feedback on my poster and made some changes. Sent my second draft to Carla, Casey and Arvind. 
* Wrote some notes on the steps for preping the assay plate. 

### 7/21/22
* Finished my poster and submitted it to the box folder. 
* Attended my students connects meeting 

### 7/22/22 
* Did our presentation for the meeting of the RPL updates and then attended the meeting 
* Attended a meeting about how to do posters and how to present them 

### 7/25/22
* Worked on writing down the steps for some of Priyanka's papers 
* Started to write the script for the audio recording of my poster presentation 
* Started the outline for my paper 

### 7/26/22
* Went to Building 446 and finalized the loop for the incubation of the plates and figured out what needs to go into the Hidex protocol. 
* Started to write the whole protocol down (Documentation) 

### 7/27/22
* Went to building 446 and completed a run of the whole protocol in triplicate with cells and nutrients. Preparing the materials (Plate with cells, plate with stock nutrients and plate with media) and running the protocol, took aproximately 4 hoours and a half. 
* Started to work with my paper and audio script for my poster presentation. 
### 7/28/22
* We got the results after the incubation period for the assay plates was complete. 
* We graphed and analyzed the results 
* Continued to worked with my paper and poster audio presentation
