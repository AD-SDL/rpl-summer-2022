## Project description

Creating a fully autonomous lab with robots used for biology experiments. 

<h2> Diary </h2>

<h2> 6/21: </h2>
* Made code simpler removed unnecessary features.<br>
* Learned re.search feature to find string that matches certain format with regular expressions.

<h2>6/24: </h2>
* Continued ROS lessons - Finished creating first launch file.

<h2>6/27: </h2>
* Worked on ROS -- created first package

<h2>6/28: </h2>
* Continued ROS lessons<br>
* Created some additional files for the peeler package based on pf400 files

<h2>6/29: </h2>
* Continued ROS lessons -- created more packages learned about nodes


<h2>6/30: </h2>
* Continued ROS lessons -- learned more about creating packages and using topics<br>
* Learned about master and the other nodes/modules

<h2>7/1 </h2>
* Started creating Readme for the peeler driver <br>
* Based it off of pf400 Readme

<h2> 7/5 </h2>
* Finished creating a more comprehensive Readme <br>
* Cleaned up azenta driver and pushed the updated version 

<h2> 7/6 </h2>
* Converted resume to overleaf <br>

<h2> 7/7 </h2>
* Worked on creating personal website <br>
* Continued ROS lessons

<h2> 7/8 </h2>
* Started creating website <br>
* Worked on ROS tutorials

<h2> 7/11 </h2>
* Made personal website

<h2> 7/12 </h2>
* Worked on ROS tutorials

<h2> 7/13 </h2>
* Set up a ROS talker and listener<br>
* Found out that a secure network is needed or else talker is sending information to entire Argonne Auth network

<h2> 7/14 </h2>
* Created a plan for ROS integration <br>
* Updated readme to include example outputs for the commands

<h2> 7/15 </h2>
* Worked with Eric to create ROS wrapper for sealer/peeler<br>
* A ROS wrapper is used to integrate ROS files with non ROS files<br>
* Created packages, nodes, and contained drivers

<h2> 7/18 </h2>
* Went through steps to be able to send commands to Peeler on MJ<br>
* Documented setup steps for this in readme<br>
* Made nodes able to send commands to peeler and sealer<br>
* Modified peeler client to store all output in variable that can be called by the nodes<br>
* Implemented if statements with switch case

<h2> 7/19 </h2>
* Documented peelerNode and peeler_client<br>
* Created sealerNode based on peelerNode

<h2> 7/20 </h2>
* Explored using services<br>
* Made description node into a service

<h2> 7/20 </h2>
* Worked through errors with running code on ROS<br>
* Worked on creating camera node<br>
* Modified Peeler node based on changes made (made action and description services instead of topics)

<h2> 7/25 </h2>
* Finished peeler/sealer drivers

<h2> 7/26 </h2>
* Began working on peeler client/figured out how Raf was sending commands

<h2> 7/27 </h2>
* Looked at hudson reference
* Populated client with commands

<h2> 7/28 </h2>
* Added interpreting feedback to client
* Added new commands
* Have a better idea of how moving to specific location works
