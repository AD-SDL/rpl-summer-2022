**Project name:** Pyhamilton Protocol Implementation on Hudson
**Advisor:** Arvind Ramanathan
**Email:** gcamacho@anl.gov

## Project Description
In a recent paper entitled "Flexible open-source automation for robotic engineering" (Chroy et al. 2021), a new software package named Pyhamilton was presented which allows the user to program the actions of Hamilton STAR and STARlet liquid handling robots using standard Python. The capabilities of Pyhamilton were demonstrated by preforming several biological experiments including the use of a feedback loop to maintain culture turbidostats and a high-throughput perturbation analysis of metabolites.For this project, we will reproduce one of the biological experiments presented in this paper using the Python interface that has been developed for the Hudson SOLO liquid handler and Hudson SoftLinx integration system. We aim to prove that our completely open-source Python API is capable of executing the same biological experiments as Pyhamilton with similar results. Students on this project will also contribute to the growing library of biological protocols written for our Hudson robotic experimentation platform.

## Diary

### 6/24
* I attended a group recap meeting 
* I presented for journal club and finished the slides for that
* I learned how to add to github and make a pull request
* I downloaded git

### 6/27
* I met with Halona and Arleen to work on the PyHamilton Protocol
* I read and annotated the Chemputer/XDL paper
* I read more of *Machine Learning: A Concise Introduction*

### 6/28
* I met with Halona and Arleen to continue our work from 6/27 and assemble the code we wrote in the right chronological order
* I met with Casey to rework our approach for the coding of preparing the dilution plate
* I read more of *Machine Learning: A Concise Introduction*
* I started the new code for the preparation of the dilution plate and made calculations for the volumes we would use of each treatment and M9 media
