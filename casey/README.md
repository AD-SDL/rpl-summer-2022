## 6/28/22
- Located all supplies required for first test run of the 384-well growth assay test
- Met with Gillian, Halona, and Arleen to go over the Pyhamilton protocol dilution steps
- Worked with Abe to debug the 384-well growth curve assay in preparation for testing tomorrow

## 6/29/22 
- Met with Priyanka and Abe to implement final changes to the 384-well protocol
- Started first real test of the 384-well growth curve protocol
- Went over notes on DNA Assembly to prepare for leading the DNA Assembly tutorial tomorrow
- Made dashboard to record progress on 384-well protocol

## 6/30/22
- presented Learn Something New Series tutorial on DNA Assembly with Priyanka
- met with Pete's team to explain coding differences between OT-2 and Hudson liquid handling protocols

## 7/1/22
